OCR
OCR is formerly known as Optical Character Recognition which is revolutionary for the digital world nowadays. OCR is actually a complete process under which the images/documents which are present in a digital world are processed and from the text are being processed out as normal editable text.

Purpose of OCR
OCR is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data.

What is EasyOCR?
EasyOCR is actually a python package that holds PyTorch as a backend handler. EasyOCR like any other OCR(tesseract of Google or any other) detects the text from images but in my reference, while using it I found that it is the most straightforward way to detect text from images also when high end deep learning library(PyTorch) is supporting it in the backend which makes it accuracy more credible. EasyOCR supports 42+ languages for detection purposes. EasyOCR is created by the company named Jaided AI company.
